Hi! I am a third-year student majoring in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). 

I am interested in applying AI algorithms in the field of AI for Healthcare. I have been working on Electronic Health Records (EHR) with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Multimodal approaches. 

I love to discuss new ideas related to or beyond those topics and methods. Please email me to start a chat if you are interested.

I am fortunate to be guided by a number of great mentors whose words and experiences have helped me embark on this great journey in research. Particularly, Professor Lequan Yu and Mr. Fuying Wang have provided me with a lot of support.
