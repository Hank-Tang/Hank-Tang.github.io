Hi! I am currently a research intern at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. I work for Dr. Deborah Winter. I am a junior-year undergraduate student majoring in Applied Artificial Intelligence. My home university is the University of Hong Kong.

I am interested in AI for Healthcare. I am currently focused on building interpretable and robust computational genomic and EHR (Electronic Health Records) models with deep connection to clinical domain knowledge enhancement. My current research efforts involve using Deep Learning, Graph Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Multimodal Learning. 

I love to discuss new ideas related to or beyond those topics and methods. Please email me or message me via LinkedIn to start a chat if you are interested.

I am fortunate to be guided by a number of great mentors whose words and experiences have helped me embark on this great journey in research. I am grateful for Dr. Deborah Winter, Dr. Lequan Yu, and Mr. Fuying Wang.
